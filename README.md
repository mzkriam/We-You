# We & You Website 

This repository contains the code for the We & You website, which I developed as an independent programmer. My focus was on creating a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: A clean and contemporary look that aligns with current design trends.
- **Interactive Elements**: Dynamic features that engage users throughout their visit.
